Fresh, responsive, and interactive ‚Äî just like our food.
üìå Project Overview

Tasty Eats is a modern, responsive restaurant landing page designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates a real-world food business interface with a visually rich layout, interactive sections, and smooth user experience ‚Äî all without using any libraries or frameworks.
The website includes four core sections:
Home (hero section with call-to-action)
About Us (mission and culinary philosophy)
Blog (sample article with food tips)
Contact (email and phone details)
