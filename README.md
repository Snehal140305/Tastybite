üçΩÔ∏è Tasty Eats ‚Äì Responsive Food Website

Fresh, responsive, and interactive ‚Äî just like our food.

üìå Project Overview

Tasty Eats is a modern, responsive restaurant landing page designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates a real-world food business interface with a visually rich layout, interactive sections, and smooth user experience ‚Äî all without using any libraries or frameworks.

The website includes four core sections:

Home (hero section with call-to-action)

About Us (mission and culinary philosophy)

Blog (sample article with food tips)

Contact (email and phone details)

‚ú® Key Features

Sticky Navbar: Navigation bar stays fixed at the top as users scroll, improving accessibility.

Responsive Hamburger Menu: A ‚ò∞ icon appears on smaller screens in the top-right corner. Clicking it reveals the navbar in a clean horizontal layout.

Animated Sections: About, Blog, and Contact sections smoothly fade and slide into view as the user scrolls.

Mobile Optimization: Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries for all screen sizes.

Clean UI/UX: Thoughtfully styled with a dark/light contrast and attractive background imagery.
